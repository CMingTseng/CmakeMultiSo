# CmakeMultiSo
This project shows how to create our own sdk by importing a third party sdk.
What's more, we will also create a jni interfae for test.

There are three layers:
1. liblayer1.so -- represent a third party sdk.
2. liblayer2.so -- represent our own sdk.
3. liblayer3.so -- jni interface used for test.
